# Tickers

Tickers are for when you want to do something repeatedly at regular intervals. This is unlike timers which are used for timeouts. A ticker can repeat a block of code.

## Declaring tickers

First, we need to import the `time` package

```go
import "time"
```

Then set time using `time.NewTicker(value time.duration)`. The ticker will tick after a duration specified.

```go
ticker := time.NewTicker(500 * time.Millisecond)
```

Tickers use a similar mechanism to timers: a channel that is sent values.

Here weâ€™ll use the select builtin on the channel to await the values as they arrive every 500ms.

In below example, we create ticker which ticks after each `500 Millisecond`. We create boolean channel `stoped` which will send and receive `true/false` values. We are using `select` to control channel cases.

```go
ticker := time.NewTicker(500 * time.Millisecond)
stoped := make(chan bool)

go func() {
    for {
        select {
        case <-stoped:
            fmt.Println("Ticker stoped!")
            break //breaks for loop
        case t := <-ticker.C:
            fmt.Println("Tick at ", t)
        }
    }
}()

time.Sleep(5 * time.Second) //sleeps for ticker execution
ticker.Stop()               //stops ticker
stoped <- true
```

In the above example, `select` runs in `forever for loop` which means it will look for its cases of send or receive operation of channel infinitely. Ticker channel will send values over each `500 Millisecond` till `time.Sleep()` is expired. 
Then `ticker.Stop()` will turn off ticker and `stoped` channel will send `true` value and 
select will receive value from the stoped channel and `breaks` the for a loop.
