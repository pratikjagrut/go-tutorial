# Atomic Counters

The primary mechanism for managing state in Go is communication over channels but there are a few other options for managing state. Here weâ€™ll look at using the `sync/atomic` package for atomic counters accessed by multiple goroutines.

Package atomic provides low-level atomic memory primitives useful for implementing synchronization algorithms.

In below example, we will perform counter which will be shared by all goroutines.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "sync/atomic"
)

func main(){ 
    var counter int64 //this is global counter variable 

    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    //We are creating 100 groutines
    for i := 0; i < 100; i++ { 
        wg.Add(1)
        go func ()  {
            //each goroutine will increament counter 1000 times
            for j := 0; j < 1000; j++ {
                atomic.AddInt64(&counter, 1)
            }
            wg.Done()
        }()
    }

    wg.Wait()
    //This suppose to print 100000
    //as 100 goroutines * 1000 times counter = 100000
    fmt.Println("Counter: ", counter)
    
}
```

To run:
```
go run main.go
